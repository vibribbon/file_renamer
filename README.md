sudo chown root /user/local/bin/rename_snake_recursive.sh 
sudo chmod 755 /user/local/bin/rename_snake_recursive.sh
sudo mv /user/local/bin/rename_snake_recursive.sh /user/local/bin/rename_snake_recursive

Dependancies: none

This script will RECURSIVELY rename files in and below the folder its executed from into snake_case.
